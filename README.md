Version: Redo 20210220.0

This is a successor to the existing smartshop mod, that fixes numerous issues and gripes.
It is possible to update existing installations of the smartshop mod to this version.
However, the API has changed significantly, so any mod that depended on smartshop in the
past will probably need to be updated. There is no easy way to revert to the old version,
so please test thoroughly before installing this on a live server. 

More documentation is on the TODO list. Please be patient.
